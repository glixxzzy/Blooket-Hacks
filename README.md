> My name is Greg Stewart, attorney for Blooket LLC. Consider this formal notice to cease and desist all activities regarding Blooket.com. Your intentional acts have harmed the company. In the event that you refuse, my office will be filing a complaint in the Federal District Court, District of Delaware against you. If you are a minor, you parents will be named in the complaint also as the owners of your electronics as well as permitting your actions. Blooket's complaint will list John Doe as the defendant. Subpoenas will be issued to Twitter and Github to gather all information on your accounts. Once you have been identified, a private investigator will determine your address for service of process. You consented to the State of Delaware for venue by using Blooket which you readily admit. You will be sued to Intentional torts of interference with a contract, defamation, negligent interference with a contract (your parents), computer malpractice (your parents), violation of individual state laws for hacking, violation of federal laws for hacking, intentional interference with business relations, and fraud. Once your identity is ascertained, I will diligently build a case against you and your parents. The FBI, Delaware State Police and the police in your home state will be contacted. If you have applied to college, I will personally share with each college the pending case against you so they can use the information in determining whether your admission is appropriate. My goal will be to make sure you and your parents are not only arrested but compensate Blooket fully for your actions. Blooket did nothing to you. You chose your actions. Good luck getting into a top or even medium tier college. Ben is much more patient and nice than I am. I will need you and your parents to contact my office if you wish to avoid the above. We will not be taking your word for anything as trust has expired.
